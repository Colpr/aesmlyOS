# AesmlyOS
A 16-bit assembly operating system for x86 PCs, based on the MikeOS project.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of AesmlyOS is to provide a simple and lightweight operating system for x86 PCs. 

The operating system is written in assembly language, which allows for maximum control and efficiency. It takes advantage of the 16-bit architecture of x86 processors, allowing it to run on older hardware.

AesmlyOS includes a range of basic features, such as a commandline and a text editor. It also includes some additional features, like an ASCII art program, and some games (hangman, pong and more!).

AesmlyOS is small and fast, with a minimal footprint. It can be loaded into memory from a bootable disk or USB drive, and it does not require a separate installation process.

Note: AesmlyOS is a hobby project by one developer, it's perpose is to make a better looking version of MikeOS. As such, updates may be random.
